  "summary": "Diff adds a new `useDashboardInside` hook that persists freeform text to a dedicated LocalStorage key (`dashboard-inside`) and wires it into `Dashboard.tsx` with editing state and a save handler. Placement/UI details for the actual \"Inside\" card (title text, Edit/Save/Cancel buttons, and responsive layout) are not fully verifiable from the truncated `Dashboard.tsx` diff, though `frontend-file-summaries.txt` asserts the section exists side-by-side with Quick Note on large screens.",
