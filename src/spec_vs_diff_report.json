  "summary": "REQ-57 appears implemented by adding a new SubjectCompletionGraph component and rendering it on SubjectPage above the chapter grid, including a slow-fill animation class for newly completed chapters. REQ-58 appears addressed by changing TanStack Router route components to stable named components to avoid hook-order/runtime issues commonly associated with Minified React error #185. However, the diff also introduces an unrequested purple-themed primary color palette in index.css, which conflicts with the BuildRequest constraint to not introduce a blue/purple theme.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-58",
      "requirement": "Fix the production runtime crash showing “Minified React error #185” by reproducing it in a non-minified/dev environment to obtain the full error message/stack, identifying the root cause, and implementing a code fix so the error no longer occurs during normal app usage.",
      "reason": "While App.tsx mentions avoiding hook order issues via stable component definitions, the diff summary provides no evidence of the required reproduction step (capturing the full dev error/stack) or explicit root-cause documentation tied to #185 beyond the inline comment. The added AppErrorBoundary is not shown as wired into the app to help capture/confirm the full error either.",

    {
      "description": "Changed the app’s core theme color variables to a purple hue (e.g., --primary with hue ~280) including corresponding secondary/muted/accent/ring values.",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-57 or REQ-58, and it conflicts with the constraint: “Keep the existing dark-mode theme direction and do not introduce a blue/purple theme.”",

      "description": "Added a new AppErrorBoundary component with a full-page error UI (card, stack trace, reset/reload actions).",
      "reason": "Not explicitly requested by REQ-57 or REQ-58; the diff summary does not show it being integrated into App.tsx, so it may be extraneous or incomplete relative to the stated goal.",
